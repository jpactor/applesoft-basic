## primes.bas - Prime Number Finder

Finds and displays prime numbers within a given range.

### Algorithm Overview

The program uses trial division to test primality:

1. For each number n in range
2. Test if n is divisible by any number from 2 to √n
3. If no divisors found, n is prime

### Key Code

```basic
10 REM PRIME NUMBER FINDER
20 INPUT "FIND PRIMES UP TO: "; LIMIT
30 PRINT "2";
40 FOR N = 3 TO LIMIT STEP 2
50   ISPRIME = 1
60   FOR D = 3 TO INT(SQR(N)) STEP 2
70     IF N / D = INT(N / D) THEN ISPRIME = 0: GOTO 100
80   NEXT D
100  IF ISPRIME THEN PRINT N;
110 NEXT N
```

### Key Concepts

**Trial Division:**
- Only test odd numbers (after 2)
- Only test up to square root of n
- Skip even divisors

**Performance Optimization:**
- `STEP 2` to skip even numbers
- Early exit when divisor found
- Testing only to √n reduces checks

**Mathematical Insight:**
If n is not prime, it has at least one divisor ≤ √n.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand algorithm optimization
- Learn nested loop patterns
- Practice with mathematical operations
- See efficiency techniques in BASIC

### Sample Output

```
FIND PRIMES UP TO: 50
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47
```

## fibonacci.bas - Fibonacci Sequence

Generates the Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

### Mathematical Background

The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

### Key Code

```basic
10 REM FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
20 INPUT "HOW MANY TERMS: "; N
30 A = 0: B = 1
40 PRINT A; B;
50 FOR I = 3 TO N
60   C = A + B
70   PRINT C;
80   A = B
90   B = C
100 NEXT I
```

### Algorithm Explanation

**Iterative Approach:**

1. Start with F(0)=0, F(1)=1
2. For each new term:
   - Add previous two terms
   - Shift values: previous becomes current, current becomes previous
3. Repeat for desired count

**Why Iterative vs Recursive:**

This implementation uses iteration rather than recursion because:
- More efficient (O(n) instead of O(2^n))
- Avoids stack overflow for large n
- Clearer in BASIC

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the Fibonacci sequence
- Learn the "sliding window" pattern
- See efficient sequence generation
- Practice variable swapping

### Sample Output

```
HOW MANY TERMS: 10
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

### Interesting Facts

- Appears frequently in nature (flower petals, spiral shells)
- Ratio of consecutive terms approaches golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618)
- Used in computer science for algorithm analysis

## memory.bas - PEEK/POKE Demonstration

Demonstrates direct memory access using PEEK and POKE commands.

### What It Demonstrates

- Writing to memory with POKE
- Reading from memory with PEEK
- Memory address ranges
- Emulated memory space

### Key Code

```basic
10 REM MEMORY DEMONSTRATION
20 HOME
30 PRINT "POKE/PEEK DEMONSTRATION"
40 PRINT

50 REM WRITE VALUES TO MEMORY
60 FOR I = 0 TO 9
70   POKE 768 + I, I * 10
80 NEXT I

90 REM READ VALUES BACK
100 PRINT "MEMORY AT 768-777:"
110 FOR I = 0 TO 9
120   V = PEEK(768 + I)
130   PRINT "ADDRESS "; 768 + I; ": "; V
140 NEXT I
```

### Memory Concepts

**Page 3 ($300-$3FF):**
- Addresses 768-1023
- Traditionally used for machine code routines
- Safe area for user programs

**Memory Safety:**
- This interpreter uses emulated memory
- Won't affect your actual computer's memory
- Bounds checking prevents invalid access

### Learning Objectives

- Understand memory addressing
- Learn PEEK/POKE syntax
- See hexadecimal addressing
- Practice with memory operations

### Sample Output

```
POKE/PEEK DEMONSTRATION

MEMORY AT 768-777:
ADDRESS 768: 0
ADDRESS 769: 10
ADDRESS 770: 20
ADDRESS 771: 30
ADDRESS 772: 40
ADDRESS 773: 50
ADDRESS 774: 60
ADDRESS 775: 70
ADDRESS 776: 80
ADDRESS 777: 90
```

### Advanced Usage

**Storing Strings in Memory:**
```basic
10 S$ = "HELLO"
20 FOR I = 1 TO LEN(S$)
30   POKE 768 + I, ASC(MID$(S$, I, 1))
40 NEXT I
```

**Reading Back:**
```basic
50 FOR I = 1 TO 5
60   C = PEEK(768 + I)
70   PRINT CHR$(C);
80 NEXT I
```

50 FOR I = 5 TO 1 STEP -1
60   PRINT I; "...";
70   SLEEP 1000
80 NEXT I
90 PRINT
100 PRINT
110 PRINT "BLAST OFF!"
```

### Timing Concepts

**Milliseconds:**
- 1000 ms = 1 second
- SLEEP 500 = half second
- SLEEP 100 = one tenth second

**Use Cases:**
- Countdown timers
- Animation frames
- Pacing output for readability
- Simulating time-based processes

### Learning Objectives

- Use SLEEP for timing
- Create countdown effects
- Control program pacing
- Enhance user experience

### Sample Output

```
COUNTDOWN FROM 5...

5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...

BLAST OFF!
```

(Each number appears with a 1-second delay)
