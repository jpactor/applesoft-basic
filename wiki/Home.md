## What is Applesoft BASIC?

Applesoft BASIC was the dialect of the BASIC programming language supplied with the Apple II series of computers. This project is a modern implementation that runs on .NET, allowing you to run vintage Apple II BASIC programs on contemporary hardware.

## Key Features

- **Complete Language Support**: Full implementation of Applesoft BASIC commands and syntax
- **6502 CPU Emulation**: Authentic emulation of the Apple II's 6502 processor
- **Memory Space Emulation**: 64KB emulated memory matching the Apple II memory map
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux via .NET 10.0
- **Modern Tooling**: Built with contemporary development practices and testing
