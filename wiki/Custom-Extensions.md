# Custom Extensions

Modern extensions to Applesoft BASIC provided by this interpreter.

## Overview

While maintaining compatibility with classic Applesoft BASIC, this interpreter includes several modern extensions that enhance functionality without breaking existing programs.

## SLEEP Command

The `SLEEP` command pauses program execution for a specified duration.

### Syntax

```basic
SLEEP milliseconds
```

### Parameters

- **milliseconds**: Number of milliseconds to pause (integer, 0 or greater)

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

```basic
10 PRINT "STARTING..."
20 SLEEP 1000
30 PRINT "ONE SECOND LATER"
```

#### Countdown Timer

```basic
10 HOME
20 FOR I = 10 TO 1 STEP -1
30 PRINT I
40 SLEEP 1000
50 NEXT I
60 PRINT "BLAST OFF!"
```

#### Animation Effect

```basic
10 HOME
20 FOR I = 1 TO 20
30 HTAB I: PRINT "*"
40 SLEEP 100
50 HOME
60 NEXT I
```

#### Progress Indicator

```basic
10 PRINT "PROCESSING";
20 FOR I = 1 TO 10
30 PRINT ".";
40 SLEEP 500
50 NEXT I
60 PRINT " DONE!"
```

### Use Cases

1. **Pacing Output**: Slow down program output for readability
2. **Animation**: Create time-based animations
3. **User Experience**: Add deliberate pauses for effect
4. **Simulations**: Model time-based processes
5. **Debugging**: Add pauses to observe program state

### Notes

- Duration is specified in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 second)
- Execution blocks for the specified duration
- Does not consume significant CPU during sleep
- Minimum practical sleep is ~15-20ms on most systems

### Complete Example

See `samples/sleep.bas` for a full demonstration:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/ApplesoftBasic.Console/ApplesoftBasic.Console.csproj -- samples/sleep.bas
```

**samples/sleep.bas:**
```basic
10 REM SLEEP COMMAND DEMONSTRATION
20 HOME
30 PRINT "COUNTDOWN FROM 5..."
40 PRINT
50 FOR I = 5 TO 1 STEP -1
60 PRINT I; "...";
70 SLEEP 1000
80 NEXT I
90 PRINT
100 PRINT
110 PRINT "BLAST OFF!"
```

## Why Extensions?

### Maintaining Compatibility

The interpreter maintains full backward compatibility with classic Applesoft BASIC. All extensions:

- Use new command names that don't conflict with original syntax
- Are optional - classic programs work without modification
- Preserve original behavior of all standard commands

### Modern Development

Modern developers expect certain capabilities:

1. **Time Control**: SLEEP provides essential timing capabilities
2. **Debugging**: Helps with testing and development
3. **User Experience**: Enables better program pacing

### Future Extensions

Potential future extensions under consideration:

#### File I/O

```basic
OPEN "filename", mode
CLOSE file_number
PRINT# file_number, data
INPUT# file_number, variable
```

#### Enhanced String Functions

```basic
UCASE$(string)    : REM Convert to uppercase
LCASE$(string)    : REM Convert to lowercase
TRIM$(string)     : REM Remove leading/trailing spaces
INSTR(str$, sub$) : REM Find substring position
```

#### Date/Time Functions

```basic
DATE$             : REM Current date
TIME$             : REM Current time
TIMER             : REM Milliseconds since midnight
```

#### Extended Math

```basic
MIN(a, b)         : REM Minimum of two values
MAX(a, b)         : REM Maximum of two values
ROUND(x, digits)  : REM Round to decimal places
```

#### System Information

```basic
SYSTEM$           : REM Operating system name
VERSION$          : REM Interpreter version
```

## Extension Guidelines

If you're considering contributing an extension:

### 1. Don't Break Compatibility

- Never modify existing command behavior
- Use new command names
- Test with classic programs

### 2. Use Appropriate Names

- Choose names that wouldn't exist in classic BASIC
- Avoid single-letter commands
- Use descriptive names (e.g., `SLEEP` not `S`)

### 3. Match Applesoft Style

- Follow Applesoft syntax conventions
- Use similar parameter styles
- Maintain consistent error handling

### 4. Document Thoroughly

- Explain purpose and use cases
- Provide multiple examples
- Note any platform-specific behavior

### 5. Add Tests

- Unit tests for the extension
- Integration tests with sample programs
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Implementation Details

### SLEEP Implementation

The SLEEP command is implemented in the interpreter at:
- Command parsing: `src/ApplesoftBasic.Interpreter/Parser/BasicParser.cs`
- Execution: `src/ApplesoftBasic.Interpreter/Execution/BasicInterpreter.cs`

The implementation uses `Thread.Sleep()` for cross-platform compatibility.

### Adding New Extensions

To add a new extension:

1. **Add Token** in `src/ApplesoftBasic.Interpreter/Tokens/TokenType.cs`
2. **Add AST Node** in `src/ApplesoftBasic.Interpreter/AST/`
3. **Update Lexer** in `src/ApplesoftBasic.Interpreter/Lexer/BasicLexer.cs`
4. **Update Parser** in `src/ApplesoftBasic.Interpreter/Parser/BasicParser.cs`
5. **Implement Visitor** in `src/ApplesoftBasic.Interpreter/Execution/BasicInterpreter.cs`
6. **Add Tests** in `tests/ApplesoftBasic.Tests/`
7. **Update Documentation** in `README.md` and wiki

See [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/jpactor/applesoft-basic/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed steps.

## Requesting Extensions

Have an idea for an extension?

1. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure it doesn't conflict with Applesoft BASIC
2. **Open an Issue**: Use the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/jpactor/applesoft-basic/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
3. **Explain Use Case**: Describe why the extension would be valuable
4. **Provide Examples**: Show how it would be used

## Extension Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Preserve History**: Original Applesoft BASIC behavior is sacred
2. **Add Value**: Extensions should solve real problems
3. **Stay Minimal**: Don't bloat the language unnecessarily
4. **Be Practical**: Focus on useful, implementable features

### What Makes a Good Extension?

✅ **Good Extensions:**
- Solve common problems (like SLEEP for timing)
- Are easy to understand and use
- Have clear, unambiguous syntax
- Work across platforms
- Don't duplicate existing functionality

❌ **Avoid:**
- Features that change existing behavior
- Platform-specific commands (unless clearly marked)
- Overly complex syntax
- Features that can be easily implemented in BASIC itself

## Compatibility Mode

### Future Feature

A potential future feature is a strict compatibility mode:

```basic
10 COMPAT "APPLESOFT"   : REM DISABLE EXTENSIONS
20 SLEEP 1000           : REM WOULD CAUSE ERROR
```

This would allow testing programs for strict Applesoft BASIC compatibility.
