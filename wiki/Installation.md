# Installation

This guide will help you get BackPocketBASIC up and running on your system.

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

- **[.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)** or later
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Supported Platforms

The interpreter runs on any platform that supports .NET 10.0:

- **Windows** 10/11 (x64, ARM64)
- **macOS** 10.15+ (x64, ARM64/Apple Silicon)
- **Linux** (various distributions, x64, ARM64)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bad-Mango-Solutions/back-pocket-basic.git
cd back-pocket-basic
```

### 2. Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore BackPocketBasic.slnx
```

This will download all required NuGet packages:
- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
- Serilog
- Autofac
- NUnit (for tests)
- Moq (for tests)

### 3. Build the Solution

```bash
dotnet build BackPocketBasic.slnx
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)
```

**Note**: You may see warnings about `Console.Beep` platform compatibility. These are expected and can be safely ignored.

### 4. Run Tests (Optional)

Verify the installation by running the test suite:

```bash
dotnet test BackPocketBasic.slnx
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Passed! - Failed:     0, Passed:   103, Skipped:     0, Total:   103
```

### 5. Build Release Version (Optional)

For better performance, build the release version:

```bash
dotnet build BackPocketBasic.slnx --configuration Release
```

## Verifying Installation

Test your installation by running a sample program:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/BadMango.Basic.Console/BadMango.Basic.Console.csproj -- samples/demo.bas
```

You should see output from the demo program demonstrating various BASIC features.

## Directory Structure

After installation, your directory should look like this:

```
back-pocket-basic/
├── src/
│   ├── BadMango.Basic/    # Core interpreter library
│   └── BadMango.Basic.Console/        # Console application
├── tests/
│   └── BadMango.Basic.Tests/          # Unit tests
├── samples/                           # Sample BASIC programs
├── BackPocketBasic.slnx                 # Solution file
└── README.md
```

## Building Individual Projects

You can also build individual projects:

```bash
# Build just the interpreter library
dotnet build src/BadMango.Basic/BadMango.Basic.csproj

# Build just the console application
dotnet build src/BadMango.Basic.Console/BadMango.Basic.Console.csproj

# Build and run the console application
dotnet run --project src/BadMango.Basic.Console/BadMango.Basic.Console.csproj
```

## IDE Support

### Visual Studio

1. Open `BackPocketBasic.slnx` in Visual Studio 2022 or later
2. Ensure .NET 10.0 SDK is installed
3. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
4. Run tests from Test Explorer

### Visual Studio Code

1. Install the C# extension
2. Open the `applesoft-basic` folder
3. Use `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build
4. Run tests with `dotnet test` in the terminal

### JetBrains Rider

1. Open `BackPocketBasic.slnx` in Rider
2. Rider will automatically restore dependencies
3. Build and run using the UI or Ctrl+F9

## Troubleshooting

### "SDK not found" Error

**Problem**: `The command could not be loaded, possibly because: You intended to execute a .NET application...`

**Solution**: Install the .NET 10.0 SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

### Build Warnings About Console.Beep

**Problem**: Warning about `Console.Beep` not being supported on all platforms

**Solution**: This is expected and can be ignored. The code includes platform checks to handle this gracefully.

### "Project file does not exist" Error

**Problem**: `The project file does not exist`

**Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct directory. Run `pwd` (Unix) or `cd` (Windows) to check your location.

### NuGet Package Restore Fails

**Problem**: Cannot restore NuGet packages

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear NuGet cache
dotnet nuget locals all --clear

# Retry restore
dotnet restore BackPocketBasic.slnx
```

### Tests Fail

**Problem**: Some tests fail during `dotnet test`

**Solution**: This may indicate an environment issue. Check:
- Correct .NET version is installed (`dotnet --version`)
- All dependencies were restored
- Try a clean build: `dotnet clean && dotnet build`

## Next Steps

Now that you have the interpreter installed:

1. **[Quick Start](Quick-Start)** - Learn how to run BASIC programs
2. **[Language Reference](Language-Reference)** - Explore Applesoft BASIC commands
3. **[Sample Programs](Sample-Programs)** - Try the included examples

## Uninstalling

To remove the interpreter, simply delete the `applesoft-basic` directory:

```bash
rm -rf applesoft-basic
```
