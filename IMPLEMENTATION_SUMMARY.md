## What Cannot Be Automated

Due to system limitations, the following tasks require manual action by the repository owner via GitHub web interface:

### 1. Branch Renaming
- **Action Required**: Settings → Branches → Rename master to main
- **Documentation**: BRANCH_MIGRATION.md
- **Impact**: Changes default branch for all future operations

### 2. Branch Protection Rules
- **Action Required**: Settings → Branch protection rules → Add rule for main
- **Documentation**: BRANCH_PROTECTION.md
- **Recommended Settings**:
  - Require pull request reviews (1+ approvals)
  - Require status checks (build, test)
  - Require conversation resolution
  - Disable force pushes
  - Disable deletions
  - Restrict who can push (owner only)

### 3. Issue Comment
- **Action Required**: Post comment to original issue
- **Documentation**: ISSUE_COMMENT.md provides ready-to-copy template
- **Purpose**: Notify contributors about branch rename

### 4. Repository Permissions
- **Action Required**: Settings → Collaborators and teams
- **Documentation**: REPOSITORY_SETTINGS.md
- **Recommendation**: Keep current configuration (owner has admin access)

### 5. Make Repository Public
- **Action Required**: Settings → Danger Zone → Change visibility
- **Documentation**: REPOSITORY_SETTINGS.md
- **Pre-requisites**: 
  - Complete security scan (no secrets in history)
  - Review pre-public checklist
  - Configure branch protections first

### 6. Enable Security Features
- **Action Required**: Settings → Code security and analysis
- **Documentation**: REPOSITORY_SETTINGS.md
- **Features to Enable**:
  - Dependabot alerts
  - Dependabot security updates
  - Code scanning (CodeQL)
  - Secret scanning (automatic for public repos)

## Testing and Verification

### Build Verification
```bash
dotnet build BackPocketBasic.slnx --configuration Release
Result: ✅ Success (2 warnings about Console.Beep, not critical)
```

### Test Verification
```bash
dotnet test BackPocketBasic.slnx --configuration Release
Result: ✅ All 103 tests pass
```

### CI/CD Workflow
- ✅ Workflow file created and validated
- ✅ Uses .NET 10.0 (matches project configuration)
- ✅ Includes build, test, and code quality jobs
- ⏳ Will run automatically once PR is merged
