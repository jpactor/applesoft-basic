# emudbg — Emulator Debug Console

`emudbg` is the primary interactive (and scriptable) debug console for the BackPocketBASIC emulator. It provides a REPL for inspecting and controlling a live emulated 65C02 / Apple II machine, including:

- CPU registers, memory, disassembly
- Stepping, running, breakpoints, watchpoints, tracing
- Disk image management (insert/eject, create, inspect)
- Video window control and soft switches
- Profile switching
- Many other diagnostic commands

It is designed to be useful for both human developers and AI agents / automation.

## Building and Launching

From the repository root:

```bash
# Build
dotnet build BackPocketBasic.slnx

# Run (interactive by default)
dotnet run --project src/BadMango.Emulator.Debug

# Or directly after build
src/BadMango.Emulator.Debug/bin/Debug/net10.0/emudbg.exe
```

On startup it loads a default profile (usually `pocket2e-a2-enh`) and presents a prompt.

## Command-Line Options

```text
emudbg [options]
```

| Option              | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `-p, --profile <name>` | Load the named machine profile at startup (e.g. `pocket2e-lite`, `simple-65c02`) |
| `-e, --exec <commands>` | Execute semicolon- or newline-separated commands then exit (non-interactive) |
| `-f, --file <path>` | Read and run commands from a text file (one per line) |
| `--json`, `-j`      | Enable structured JSON output for supported commands (e.g. `regs`, `dasm`) |
| `--no-banner`       | Suppress the startup banner and input prompts |
| `--headless`        | Use Avalonia's built-in headless platform (enables offscreen video rendering and diagnostics for AI agents, servers, CI) |
| `-h, --help`        | Show usage and exit |

### Examples

```powershell
# Show help
emudbg --help

# Start with a minimal profile
emudbg -p simple-65c02

# Run a short non-interactive session
emudbg --exec "boot;regs;step 20;regs;exit" --no-banner

# Get structured JSON output (for agents/tools)
emudbg --json --exec "regs;exit" --no-banner

# Headless + JSON for agent/CI use (no display needed)
emudbg --headless --json --exec "switches;regions;pages;exit"

# Use a script file
emudbg --file debug-sequence.emudbg --no-banner
```

When using `--exec` or `--file`, `emudbg` uses a **lightweight "run commands and exit" path** (via `ExecuteBatch` / direct `ProcessLine` dispatch on the `CommandDispatcher` and `ICommandContext`). This bypasses the full interactive REPL loop entirely (no prompt handling, no read loop, no banner logic in Run).

This is lower-overhead and ideal for agents/scripts. Command outputs (text or JSON) go to stdout as usual.

The REPL automatically detects non-interactive usage (e.g. when input is redirected, a StringReader is used for --exec/--file, or piped stdin) and suppresses the banner, input prompts ("> "), and exit message ("Goodbye!") for clean output capture. This makes captured stdout from scripts/agents free of REPL noise.

Use `--headless` to initialize Avalonia using its headless platform. This allows video windows and rendering to operate offscreen (e.g. for AI to inspect emulator video output via diagnostics), without requiring a physical display or windowing system. WindowManager-dependent commands continue to work.

**80-column and double modes note**: Video memory exposure and capture use *physical* main and auxiliary RAM (via IMainMemoryProvider / IExtended80ColumnDevice.ReadAuxRam) to correctly handle the hardware's direct VRAM fetch. In 80-col text/DHGR/etc., even columns come from aux, odd from main at the shared PAGE1 addresses ($0400+ for text, $2000+ for hires). This bypasses CPU-visible banking (80STORE, PAGE2, RAMRD/RAMWRT) just like real Apple IIe/c video hardware and the 80-col firmware's column bank switching. See specs/video/ and reference/ docs for details.

Explicit `--no-banner` can be used even in interactive sessions. Advanced control via the IsInteractive property is available in code.

Supported diagnostic, memory, and device commands now produce agent-friendly structured JSON when `--json` / `-j` is used (globally or per-command), or when the session was started with `--json`:

- Diagnostic: switches, regions, pages, devicemap, fault, buslog, profile
- Memory: mem, read, peek, write, poke, load, save
- Disk: disk list, disk info, disk-read-sector, etc.
- Video (headless friendly, 80-col/DHGR aware): state, screen, capture, memory (uses physical main/aux RAM via IMainMemoryProvider/IExtended80ColumnDevice to match real Apple IIe hardware interleaving and bypass 80STORE/PAGE2/RAMRD for display view)
- Others: trace (status/dump), bp (list), watch (list), dasm, regs (and many more)

This enables low-noise use from agents (e.g. `mem --json $C000 16`, `switches --json`).

Global `--json` enables it for the session. The REPL auto-suppresses all UI noise (banners, prompts, "Goodbye!") in non-interactive mode for clean capture.

## Interactive Usage

Type commands at the `> ` prompt. Use `help` or `help <command>` for information.

Common workflow:

```
> boot
> regs
> step 5
> dasm
> bp add $c030
> run
```

Press Ctrl+C or type `exit` (or `quit`) to leave.

## Key Commands

See `help` inside the console for the full live list. Highlights:

- `regs`, `pc`, `mem <addr> [len]`, `dasm [addr] [count]`
- `step [n]`, `run` / `run-until <cond>`, `halt`, `pause`, `resume`, `reset`, `boot`
  (`run-until` is dedicated shorthand: `run-until $c000`, `run-until bp`, `run-until watch`, `run-until mem $c030 01`; JSON output has rich stop info + registers + trace records)
- `bp ...` / `watch ...` (breakpoints and watchpoints)
- `trace ...` (instruction tracing)
- `profile list|load <name>`
- `disk list|info|insert|create|...`
- `video open|close|scale ...`
- `switches`, `regions`, `pages`, `fault`

Many commands accept hex addresses with `$` or `0x` prefixes.

## Profiles

Profiles describe complete machine configurations (CPU type, ROMs, devices, memory map). They live in the `profiles/` directory (copied next to the executable at build time).

Use `--profile` on the command line or the `profile load` command at runtime.

## For Agents and Scripting

See `AGENTS.md` for recommended patterns when driving `emudbg` from AI tools:

- Prefer `--exec`, `--file`, `--no-banner`, and `--json` for non-interactive runs. The REPL auto-suppresses banners/prompts/"Goodbye!" for clean captured output when using redirected input.
- Combine with piping to stdin when needed.
- Always end sequences with `exit` (or let input EOF terminate).

Example agent-friendly invocation:

```powershell
$cmds = "profile list`nboot`nregs`nstep 50`nregs`nexit"
$cmds | & "src\BadMango.Emulator.Debug\bin\Debug\net10.0\emudbg.exe" --no-banner
```
